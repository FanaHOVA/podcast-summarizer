I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI.

So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow.

So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI. So that's not in there. \\n\\n**Well, you like shaping things into containers where like, you know, unstructured things can kind of flow in. So I can, I can spin it for you. I should, I should use that. Maybe for the audience, you want to give a little bit of enthrall on guardrails, AI, what it is, why you wanted to start it.**\\n\\nYeah, yeah, for sure. So guardrails or the need for guardrails really came up as I was kind of like, you know, building some of my own projects in the space and like really solving some of my own problems. So this was back of like end of last year, I was kind of building some applications. Like everybody else was very excited about the space and I built some stuff and I quickly realized that, yeah, I could, you know, like it works like pretty well a bunch of times, but like a lot of other times it really does not work as I, the developer of this tool, like want my tool to work. \\n\\nAnd\", 'stop': None, 'stop_reason': None, 'truncated': False, 'log_id': 'c0d0d6cfb0cd0374f064a21a07d05af8', 'model': 'claude-v1-100k', 'exception': None}\n",

This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow.

You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.

So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI. So that's not in there. \\n\\n**Well, you like shaping things into containers where like, you know, unstructured things can kind of flow in. So I can, I can spin it for you. I should, I should use that. Maybe for the audience, you want to give a little bit of enthrall on guardrails, AI, what it is, why you wanted to start it.**\\n\\nYeah, yeah, for sure.

Welcome Shreya.**  \\n\\nHi, hi, excited to be here.   \\n\\n**Excited to have you too.**  \\n\\nBut this has been a long time coming, you and I have chatted a little bit and excited to learn more about guardrails. So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI. So that's not in there. \\n\\n**Well, you like shaping things into containers where like, you know, unstructured things can kind of flow in. So I can, I can spin it for you. I should, I should use that. Maybe for the audience, you want to give a little bit of enthrall on guardrails, AI, what it is, why you wanted to start it.**\\n\\nYeah, yeah, for sure. So guardrails or the need for guardrails really came up as I was kind of like, you know, building some of my own projects in the space and like really solving some of my own problems.

Welcome Shreya.**  \\n\\nHi, hi, excited to be here.   \\n\\n**Excited to have you too.**  \\n\\nBut this has been a long time coming, you and I have chatted a little bit and excited to learn more about guardrails. So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI. So that's not in there. \\n\\n**Well, you like shaping things into containers where like, you know, unstructured things can kind of flow in. So I can, I can spin it for you.

This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI.

Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.

Welcome Shreya.**  \\n\\nHi, hi, excited to be here.   \\n\\n**Excited to have you too.**  \\n\\nBut this has been a long time coming, you and I have chatted a little bit and excited to learn more about guardrails. So we do a little intro for you and then we have you fill in the blanks. So you got your bachelor's in IIT Delhi, minor in computer science with focus on AI, which is super relevant now. I bet you didn't think about that in undergrad.  \\n\\nYeah, I think it's interesting because like I started working in AI back in 2014 and back then I was like, oh, it's here. This is like almost changing the world already. So it feels like, you know, that like, it's almost like almost arriving the thing. So yeah, it's felt this way where it's almost here. It's almost changed the world for like as long as I've been working in it.  \\n\\n**That's awesome. We can explore your, like the origins of your interests because then you went on to UIUC to do your master's also in AI. And then it looks like you went to drive.ai to work on perception and then to Apple SPG as the cool kids call it special projects group working with Ian Goodfellow. And then you were at pretty base up until recently. Actually I don't know if you've quit yet.**\\n\\nI have. \\n\\n**Good. You haven't updated your LinkedIn, but we're getting the vibe breaking news that you're working on guard rails full time.**  \\n\\nYeah. Well, you know, that's the professional history of, we can double back to affiliate and blank on anything, but what's a personal side, you know, what's not on your LinkedIn that people should know about you.  \\n\\nI think the most obvious thing, this is like, this is still professional, but the most obvious thing that isn't on my LinkedIn yet is guard rail. So like you mentioned, I haven't updated my LinkedIn yet, but I quit some time ago and I've been devoting like all of my energy full time working on guard rails and, you know, growing the open source package and building out exciting features, et cetera. So that's probably the thing that's missing the most.  \\n\\nI think another more personal skill, which I think I'm like kind of okay for an amateur ad that isn't on my LinkedIn is, is pottery.  So I really enjoy pottery and yeah, don't know how to slot that in amongst like all of the AI. So that's not in there. \\n\\n**Well, you like shaping things into containers where like, you know, unstructured things can kind of flow in. So I can, I can spin it for you. I should, I should use that. Maybe for the audience, you want to give a little bit of enthrall on guardrails, AI, what it is, why you wanted to start it.**\\n\\nYeah, yeah, for sure. So guardrails or the need for guardrails really came up as I was kind of like, you know, building some of my own projects in the space and like really solving some of my own problems. So this was back of like end of last year, I was kind of building some applications. Like everybody else was very excited about the space and I built some stuff and I quickly realized that, yeah, I could, you know, like it works like pretty well a bunch of times, but like a lot of other times it really does not work as I, the developer of this tool, like want my tool to work. \\n\\nAnd then as a developer, you know, like I can tell that there's very few tools available for me to like get this to, you know, cooperate with me, like get it to follow directions, et cetera. And the only tool I really have is, you know, this prompt and there's only so, so far you can go with like putting instructions in like caps, adding a bunch of\", doc_id='0e016cef-3899-48f8-b7f8-06e1a7479e15', embedding=None, doc_hash='f49a8b6549123bb5d120fbc7dbae9c6b970c6bda6a9c09dec9a4e6c630d59b7f', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 0, 'end': 3875}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: '069f53ad-770c-4e73-906c-d17dadb5955f', <DocumentRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: 'a0b038ed-b0a7-4a94-bed6-02071ae2364e'}), score=0.7840345014773044), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"like really solving some of my own problems.
